<center><blockquote><em>Pepper Curry is a designer living and working in Wellington, New Zealand.</em></blockquote></center>


I'm a web designer for [Rabid](http://www.rabid.co.nz), as well as a founding member of the intermittent and mysterious Subterranean Mountaintop Seaside duo. I've done shirts for The Ramen Shop, posters for awesome events, and love doing illustrations for all sorts of projects. I am known as Pepper Raccoon across most of the internets.

My skills include:

  + HTML
  + CSS
  + Some JS/jQuery
  + Drawing
  + Prototyping/Wireframing

My passions are:

  + Illustration
  + Cooking
  + Knitting
  + Mountain Biking
  + Gardening
  + Magic: The Gathering (nerd factor)

My favour:

  + Plenty of outdoor time and sunshine
  + A tiny house with lots of land.
  + A happy bunch of animals to hang out with.
  + Mountain biking trails, and lots of 'em.
